# pytorch-skipthoughts

Simple, plug & play pytorch implementation of a skipthoughts encoder.
Ported from [Theano based Sent2Vec encoder](https://github.com/ryankiros/skip-thoughts), based on the paper [Skip-Thought Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06726).

## To do

* add support for vocabulary extension
* implement decoders
* add training script for custom model creation
